# Dog-Website
Creating a website for my wife and I so we can show our puppies and have a different form of comminication.

## Start the development server
```bash
npm start
```

Open a browser to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:1234)

## Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built web files will be in the `dist` folder. Just copy those onto your server to deploy.
